        <a class="textHeader">MICHAEL BETZ (MY BOYFRIEND)</a>
        <a class="textBody"> This second frame contains some objects and photos that help to present my boyfriend's identity 
            and story. Michael Betz is a very introverted, extroverted type of person. Although he loves staying at home, relaxing 
            with some candles, playing with his cats and doing his usual routine as a six flags supervisor, he also has a very 
            adventurous side. He wants to learn new languages, explore new countries that he has studied, and find a way to integrate 
            his love for those things into his profession. Aside from his background, I also wanted to ask him about some experiences 
            that he has had as a gay man; however, Mike doesnâ€™t usually like having his sexuality be the topic of conversation and tends 
            to be more casual about it. He believes that by presenting himself as his true identity rather than being super vocal about it, 
            he can slowly integrate his identity into his home life and familial relationships in a way that makes him feel more comfortable.</a>
